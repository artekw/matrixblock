# matrixblock

The goal of this project is create a cape for beaglebone black to drive a [Sure Electronic 32x16 LED Display](http://www.sureelectronics.net/goods.php?id=1095).

We plan to put on PCB RTC clock based on NXP PCF8563 chip.

## Connection

Power circuit from matrix connector, not beaglebone! Use power adapter 5V/2A.

### TODO
